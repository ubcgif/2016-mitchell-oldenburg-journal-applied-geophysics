abstract = {Contamination of groundwater by leaking CO2 is a potential risk of carbon sequestration. With the help of a field experiment in western Denmark, we investigate to what extent surface electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) can detect and image dissolved CO2 in a shallow aquifer. For this purpose, we injected CO2 at a depth of 5 and 10m and monitored its migration using 320 electrodes on a 126m×25m surface grid. A fully automated acquisition system continuously collected data and uploaded it into an online database. The large amount of data allows for time-series analysis using geostatistical techniques for noise estimation and data interpolation to compensate for intermittent instrument failure. We estimate a time-dependent noise level for each ERT configuration, taking data variation and measurement frequency into account.A baseline inversion reveals the geology at the site consisting of aeolian and glacial sands near the surface and marine sands below 10m depth. 3-D time-lapse ERT inversions clearly image the dissolved CO2 plume with decreased electrical resistivity values. We can image the geochemical changes induced by the dissolved CO2 until the end of the acquisition, 120days after the injection start. During these 120days, the CO2 migrates about 25m in the expected groundwater flow direction. Water electrical conductivity (EC) sampling using small screens in 29 wells allows for very good verification of the ERT results. Water EC and ERT results generally agree very well, with the water sampling showing some fine-scale variations that cannot be resolved by the ERT. The ERT images have their strength in outlining the plume's shape in three dimensions and in being able to image the plume outside the well field. These results highlight the potential for imaging dissolved CO2 using non-intrusive surface electrical resistivity tomography. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Electrical and electromagnetic ?E{\&}EM? methods for near- surface investigations have undergone rapid improvements over the past few decades. Besides the traditional applica- tions in groundwater investigations, natural-resource explo- ration, and geological mapping, a number of new applica- tions have appeared. These include hazardous-waste charac- terization studies, precision-agriculture applications, archeo- logical surveys, and geotechnical investigations. The inclu- sion of microprocessors in survey instruments, development ofnewinterpretation algorithms, and easy access to powerful computers have supported innovation throughout the geo- physical community and theE{\&}EMcommunity is no excep- tion. Most notable are development of continuous-measure- ment systems that generate large, dense data sets efficiently. These have contributed significantly to the usefulness of E{\&}EM methods by allowing measurements over wide areas without sacrificing lateral resolution. The availability of these luxuriant data sets in turn spurred development of inter- pretation algorithms, including: Laterally constrained 1D in- version as well as innovative 2D- and 3D-inversion methods. Taken together, these developments can be expected to im- prove the resolution and usefulness of E{\&}EM methods and permit them to be applied economically. The trend is clearly toward dense surveying over larger areas, followed by highly automated, post-acquisition processing and interpretation to provide improved resolution of the shallow subsurface in a cost-effective manner.

abstract = {Solution/collapse structures pose a serious economic threat to potash'mines in Saskatchewan due to flooding. This study encompasses the first phase of a joint Queen's University - Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan (PCS) research project, and. investigates the delineation of solution/collapse structures using in-seam seismic techniques. Three seismic survey experiments were performed at the PCS Rocanville mine where a collapse structure is located within a 1800 m X 1830 m mining panel. Two of these experiments were designed to collect data suitable for tomographic imaging. In the first survey approximately 9000 waveforms were measured on hydrophones at 96 source/receiver locations about the panel. Data required comprehensive signal processing to improve signal to noise ratios and permit estimation of P- and S-wave traveltimes for tomographic inversion. Three component data were measured in the second survey at 48 source/receiver locations and processed using polarization analysis techniques to estimate traveltimes more accurately and permit a preliminary analysis of attenuation. Traveltime data from both surveys were processed using algebraic reconstruction (ART) and matrix inversion (SVD) techniques to yield velocity images. The final experiment investigated the possibility of a back-scattering response from the structure using a standard CDP reflection survey setup within the plane of the panel. The effects of head waves on tomographic imaging observed in a pilot study were eliminated through the application of a band-pass filter. Results indicate that the extent and magnitude of an anomalous seismic response characterizing the structure are less pronounced than originally predicted. Velocity contrasts are too low to provide reliable results from the ART algorithm. SVD images of P-wave velocity reveal a restricted low-velocity zone appropriately located and probably attributable to the collapse structure. Stacked CDP sections from the third survey failed to record any reflections from the structure indicating that the acoustic impedance contrast between the disturbed zone and the unaffected rock mass is likely gradational rather than abrupt. The" lack of a more definitive response dictates that future work focus on determining more precisely the diagnostic physical properties of the collapse zone. Data from more detailed seismic studies interpreted in conjunction with those from other geophysical methods should provide this information.},

abstract = {The 3D electrical tomography (ET) method has been used to investigate two known targets, commonly associated with brownfield land. Resistivity and chargeability data were collected using a network of linear survey lines. The influence of array type and orientation was evaluated, and 2D and 3D inversion results were compared. Superior geometric and electrical property resolution of 3D models was achieved using dipole-dipole as compared to Wenner array data. 3D resistivity model resolution was shown to be sensitive to electrode array orientation, indicating that to ensure adequate resolution of strongly anisometric structures orthogonal electrode configurations should be employed. Quasi-3D models generated using 2D inversion showed a marked reduction in resolution relative to the corresponding 3D models, and were characterised by highly irregular and variable electrical property distributions. The results confirm that, subject to suitable survey design, 3D ET can provide spatial images that could significantly improve the detectability of buried man-made targets.},

abstract = {An algorithm for linear(ized) experimental design is developed for a determinant-based design objective function. This objective function is common in design theory and is used to design experiments that minimize the model entropy, a measure of posterior model uncertainty. Of primary significance in design problems is computational expediency. Several earlier papers have focused attention on posing design objective functions and opted to use global search methods for finding the critical points of these functions, but these algorithms are too slow to be practical. The proposed technique is distinguished primarily for its computational efficiency, which derives partly from a greedy optimization approach, termed sequential design. Computational efficiency is further enhanced through formulae for updating determinants and matrix inverses without need for direct calculation. The design approach is orders of magnitude faster than a genetic algorithm applied to the same design problem. However, greedy optimization often trades global optimality for increased computational speed; the ramifications of this tradeoff are discussed. The design methodology is demonstrated on a simple, single-borehole DC electrical resistivity problem. Designed surveys are compared with random and standard surveys, both with and without prior information. All surveys were compared with respect to a ‘relative quality' measure, the post-inversion model per cent rms error. The issue of design for inherently ill-posed inverse problems is considered and an approach for circumventing such problems is proposed. The design algorithm is also applied in an adaptive manner, with excellent results suggesting that smart, compact experiments can be designed in real time.},

abstract = {Experiments and surveys are often performed to obtain data that constrain some previously underconstrained model. Often, constraints are most desired in a particular subspace of model space. Experiment design optimization requires that the quality of any particular design can be both quantified and then maximized. This study shows how the quality can be defined such that it depends on the amount of information that is focused in the particular subspace of interest. In addition, algorithms are presented which allow one particular focused quality measure (from the class of focused measures) to be evaluated efficiently. A subclass of focused quality measures is also related to the standard variance and resolution measures from linearized inverse theory. The theory presented here requires that the relationship between model parameters and data can be linearized around a reference model without significant loss of information. Physical and financial constraints define the space of possible experiment designs. Cross-well tomographic examples are presented, plus a strategy for survey design to maximize information about linear combinations of parameters such as bulk modulus, kappa = lambda + 2 mu/3.},

A combination of resistivity imaging, core drilling and geophysical logging was found to provide a good overview of the variation in rock quality and detailed information on the engineering geological characteristics and genesis of the strata. Resistivity data, acquired along parallel lines over the zones using multi-electrode equipment, were processed by means of automatic inversion software to generate sections showing the variation of resistivity with depth. Wireline core drilling at selected points gave an almost complete core recovery, which revealed major sedimentary sequences and heavily weathered crystalline rocks that were previously unknown or only partially known despite conventional core drilling and percussion drilling. Geophysical borehole logging confirms the resistivity imaging results, and would be a particularly valuable complement to core logging in cases where significant core loss occurs.},

abstract = {Electrical resistivity tomography ({\{}ERT){\}} monitoring experiments are being conducted more often to image spatiotemporal changes in soil properties. When conducting long-term {\{}ERT{\}} monitoring, the identification of suspicious electrodes in a permanent spread is of major importance because changes in electrode contact properties of a single electrode may affect the quality of many measurements on each time-slice. An automated methodology was developed to detect these temporal changes in electrode contact properties, based on a Bayesian approach called "weights of evidence." Contrasts (C-W) and studentized contrasts (C-S) are estimators of the influence of each electrode in the global data quality. A consolidated studentized contrast ({\{}CCS){\}} is introduced to consider the proportion of rejected quadripoles which contain a single electrode. These estimators are computed for each time-slice using Q-factor (coefficient of variation of repeated measurements) threshold values, from 0 to 10{\%}, to discriminate between selected and rejected quadripoles. An automated detection strategy is proposed to identify suspicious electrodes by comparing the {\{}CCS{\}} to the {\{}MECS{\}} (maximum expected C-S values when every electrode is good for the given data set). These {\{}MECS{\}} are computed using Monte-Carlo simulations of a hundred random draws where the distribution of Q-factor values follows a Weibull cumulative distribution, with k = 0.421 and lambda = 1.303, fitted on a background data set filtered using a 5{\%} threshold on absolute reciprocal errors. The efficiency of the methodology and its sensitivity to the selected reciprocal error threshold are assessed on synthetic and field data. Our approach is suitable to detect suspicious electrodes and slowly changing conditions affecting the galvanic contact resistances where classical approaches are shown to be inadequate except when the faulty electrode is disconnected. A data-weighting method is finally proposed to ensure that only good data will be used in the inversion of {\{}ERT{\}} monitoring data sets.},

abstract = {Inconsistencies between an object and its image delivered by tomographical methods are inevitable. Loss of information occurs during the survey through incomplete and inaccurate data sampling and may also be introduced during the inverse procedure by smoothness constraints inadequate to the resolving power of the experimental setup. A quantitative appraisal of image quality (spatial resolution and image noise) is therefore not only required for successful interpretation of images but can be used together with measures of efficiency of the experimental design to optimize survey and inverse procedures. This paper introduces a low-contrast inversion scheme for electrical resistivity tomography that supports the reconstructed image with estimates of model resolution, model covariance and data importance. The algorithm uses a truncated pseudo-inverse and a line search approach to determine the maximum number of degrees of freedom necessary to fit the data to a prescribed target misfit. Though computationally expensive, the virtue of the method is that it reduces subjectivity by avoiding any empirically motivated model smoothness constraints. The method can be incorporated into a full non-linear inversion scheme for which a posteriori quality estimates can be calculated. In a numerical 2-D example the algorithm yielded reasonable agreement between object and image even for moderate resistivity contrasts of 10:100:1000. On the other hand, the resolving power of an exemplary four-electrode data set containing classical dipole-dipole and non-conventional configurations was shown to be severely affected by data inaccuracy. Insight into the resolving power as a function of space and data accuracy can be used as a guideline to designing optimized data sets, smoothness constraints and model parametrization.},

abstract = {In early 1987, the Patience Lake potash mine near Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, was closed due to uncontrollable flooding. Water inflows were first encountered during routine mining in 1975 at the south boundary of the mine lease. Underground grouting and construction of bulkheads limited the flow but did not completely stop it. Subsequent seismic surveys showed that the mine had approached the edge of a large collapse structure in which the salt and potash had been partly dissolved and removed by groundwater. In 1986, the small flow into the mine started to grow. Despite renewed grouting, the flood increased and outstripped pump capacity. The grouting program temporarily slowed the inflow but was unable to stop it. Eventually, from seismic and drilling evidence, it became clear that the water source was an extensive system of vertical fractures which would be impossible to seal by drilling and grouting from underground. A new plan to install 14 bulkheads underground would have sealed the water source from the rest of the mine but the construction program could not be completed before rapidly increasing inflows threatened to fill the mine. The underground mine was closed and a new solution mine started in 1988.},

abstract = {For both experimental design and interpretation of inversion results it is useful to analyze resolution power and model uncertainties. The model resolution matrix can significantly help to understand the quality of the inversion process. On this basis, it is possible to find measures for information content and efficiency of data sets depending on the noise level. On the other hand, it is possible to investigate how different inversion and regularization schemes affect resolution power. The singular value decomposition (svd) can be used to calculate generalized inverse matrices, which lead to resolution matrices for truncated svd (tsvd) inversion and Tikhonov regularization. With some additional effort, a generalized svd (gsvd) can also be applied to arbitrary model restrictions like smoothness constraints. For reasons of comparability, a one step linearized inversion scheme is applied. Whereas tsvd and Tikhonov regularization rather produce noise artifacts, smooth- ness constraints and weighting by coverage tend to produce artifacts near the boundaries. As far as the comparison of data sets is concerned, the highest information contents are achieved using pole-dipole and dipole-dipole configurations, the lowest ones us- ing pole-pole and Wenner type arrays. In all cases enlarged dipole lengths for large separations and augmented data sets using so called circulated data significantly increase the information content.},

abstract = {The equivalence problem in geoelectrical data interpretation is a well-known fact. Generally, the equivalence analysis is implemented into 1D data inversion software but completely neglected in 2D data interpretation. In this paper, we present a practical approach to the problem of equivalence in a 2D data inversion. A 1D interpretation with equivalence analysis of the data is used to generate different starting models for a 2D inversion. At suitable locations, sounding curves are extracted from the 2D data set and inverted. Calculation of equivalent 1D results is carried out at each sounding point. The different resulting models are connected laterally to form different starting models for a 2D inversion of the complete 2D data set. Our 2D inversion results, similar in terms of data fit, but very different regarding the resulting resistivity distributions, enforce the necessity to carry out equivalence analysis in 2D data interpretations. It is shown that the implementation of a 1D interpretation of a 2D data set of predominantly layered structures provides a suitable way to introduce a first-order equivalence analysis to the problem in 2D. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V.

The clustering problem has been addressed in many contexts and by researchers in many disciplines; this reflects its broad appeal and usefulness as one of the steps in exploratory data analysis. However, clustering is a difficult problem combinatorially, and differences in assumptions and contexts in different communities has made the transfer of useful generic concepts and methodologies slow to occur. This paper presents an overview of pattern clustering methods from a statistical pattern recognition perspective, with a goal of providing useful advice and references to fundamental concepts accessible to the broad community of clustering practitioners. We present a taxonomy of clustering techniques, and identify cross-cutting themes and recent advances. We also describe some important applications of clustering algorithms such as image segmentation, object recognition, and information retrieval.},

abstract = {Understanding the deformation processes in potash mines is very important for safe mining, planning the methods of extracting the orebody, and the prevention of catastrophic water inflow. A variety of deformational structures are present in the Upper Kama potash deposit. Folding is a dominant and most common form of deformation of ductile evaporites (herein also referred to as salts). Brittle deformation occurs rarely but is of more significance from the perspective of mine safety because fractures affect the supporting capability of mine pillars and can provide passageway for water inflow. Continuous common offset ground penetrating radar (GPR) data were acquired in the potash mine operated by the Joint Stock Company (JSC) "Silvinit" to investigate a set of pre-existing fractures and related deformational structures. Open fractures, faults and folds were mapped using 2-D and 3-D GPR techniques. Detection of millimetric scale fractures was available due to high salt/air dielectric properties contrast and low background noise within uniform salt rock. FK filtering significantly improved fracture detection and imaging. A spatial model of one set of fractures was created using 3-D GPR imaging. Migration was applied to GPR data to obtain the true geometry of the strongly folded salt beds. The results of studies showed that GPR is capable of providing valuable information about deformation within the evaporite formations of the Upper Kama potash deposit. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {This research provides an empirical study of electrodes used to measure galvanic resistivity. The central element of this work is an estimation of errors in resistivity measure- ments that arise because of the type of electrode material used. Fourteen types of electrodes were tested including metal electrodes, metal-salt-compound (nonpolarizing) elec- trodes, and one nonmetal electrode, under conditions that are typical of those encountered during geophysical surveys. Measurement errors for resistance and chargeability were es- timated using the reciprocity of data from an array of electrodes such as might be used for electric-resistance tomography. The same error analysis was applied to data from a network of high-precision resistors to separate instrument errors from electrode errors. Significant differences were observed in errors produced by different electrode materials.We conclude that the choice of electrode is very important for resistivity or chargeability surveys. Iron, steel (including rebar), lead, and phosphor bronze produced the smallest errors in resistance and chargeability. Aluminum, magnesium, titanium, copper, and zinc produced the largest errors. Stainless steel (alloy 316), tin, and brass performed reasonably well, as did carbon, which was the only nonmetal tested.},

abstract = {Survey design ultimately dictates the quality of subsurface information provided by practical implementations of geophysical methods. It is therefore critical to design experimental procedures that cost effectively produce those data that maximize the desired information. This review cites recent advances in statistical experimental design techniques applied in the earth sciences. Examples from geoelectrical, crosswell and surface seismic, and microseismic monitoring methods are included. Using overdetermined 1D and 2D geoelectrical examples, a minor subset of judiciously chosen measurements provides a large percentage of the information content theoretically offered by the geoelectrical method. In contrast, an underdetermined 2D seismic traveltime tomography design study indicates that the information content increases almost linearly with the amount of traveltime data (source-receiver pairs) considered until the underdeterminancy is reduced substantially. An experimental design study of frequency-domain seismic-waveform inversion experiments reveals that a few optimally chosen frequencies offer as much subsurface information as the full bandwidth. A nonlinear experimental design for a seismic amplitude-versus-angle survey identifies those incidence angles most important for characterizing a reservoir. A nonlinear design example shows that designing microseismic monitoring surveys based on array aperture is a poor strategy that almost certainly leads to suboptimal designs.},

This is referred to here as injection electrode overprinting. Overprinting may occur in resistivity measurements when an electrode is used as a receiving electrode immediately following duty as an injection electrode, such as in multi-electrode systems with automatic switching. The circumstances that produce overprinting are demonstrated here and recommendations are made to limit its occurrence and effect. It is found that the overvoltage on injection electrodes is unlikely to exceed a few volts and that the period of rapid, nonlinear, decay is over in a few seconds. Most modern resistivity equipment can easily accommodate potentials with these characteristics as part of spontaneous potential rejection.

@article{Miller2007,
abstract = {ABSTRACT Practical decisions are often made based on the subsurface  images obtained by inverting geophysical data. Therefore it is important to understand the resolution of the image, which is a function of several factors, including the underlying geophysical experiment, noise in the data, prior information and the ability to model the physics appropriately. An important step towards interpreting the image is to quantify how much of the solution is required to satisfy the data observations and how much exists solely due to the prior information used to stabilize the solution. A procedure to identify the regions that are not constrained by the data would help when interpreting the image. For linear inverse problems this procedure is well established, but for non-linear problems the procedure is more complicated. In this paper we compare two different approaches to resolution analysis of geophysical images: the region of data influence index and a resolution spread computed using point spread functions. The region of data influence method is a fully non-linear approach, while the point spread function analysis is a linearized approach. An approximate relationship between the region of data influence and the resolution matrix is derived, which suggests that the region of data influence is connected with the rows of the resolution matrix. The point-spread-function spread measure is connected with the columns of the resolution matrix, and therefore the point-spread-function spread and the region of data influence are fundamentally different resolution measures. From a practical point of view, if two different approaches indicate similar interpretations on post-inversion images, the confidence in the interpretation is enhanced. We demonstrate the use of the two approaches on a linear synthetic example and a non-linear synthetic example, and apply them to a non-linear electromagnetic field data example.},

abstract = {Limitations of imaging using electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) arise because of the difficulty of quantifying the reliability of tomographic images. A major source of uncertainty in tomographic inversion is data error. Data error due to electrode mislocations is characterized by the sensitivity of electrical potential to both source and receiver positions. This sensitivity is described by a scattering-type equation and, therefore, depends not only on source--receiver separation, but also on the location and magnitude of contrasts in electrical conductivity. At the overlapping scales of near-surface environmental and engineering geophysical surveys, for which electrodes may be close to the target and experiment dimensions may be on the same order as those of the target, errors associated with electrode mislocations can significantly contaminate the ERT data and the reconstructed electrical conductivity. For synthetic experiments, variations in the data due to electrode mislocation are comparable in magnitude to typical experimental noise levels and, in some cases, may overwhelm variations in the data due to changes in material properties. Furthermore, the statistical distribution of electrode mislocation errors can be complicated and multimodal such that bias may be introduced into the ERT data. The resulting perturbations of the reconstructed electrical conductivity field due to electrode mislocations can be significant in magnitude with complex spatial distributions that are dependent both on the model and the experiment.},

It is often impractical to expect a human with sufficient domain knowledge to be available to select the number of clusters/segments to return. We investigate techniques to determine the number of clusters or segments to return from hierarchical clustering and segmentation algorithms. We propose an efficient algorithm, the L method that finds the "knee" in a '{\#} of clusters vs. clustering evaluation metric' graph. Using the knee is well-known, but is not a particularly well-understood method to determine the number of clusters. We explore the feasibility of this method, and attempt to determine in which situations it will and will not work. We also compare the L method to existing methods based on the accuracy of the number of clusters that are determined and efficiency. Our results show favorable performance for these criteria compared to the existing methods that were evaluated.},

abstract = {Electrical imaging of tracer tests can provide valuable information on the spatial variability of solute transport processes. This concept was investigated by cross-borehole electrical imaging of a controlled release in an experimental tank. A saline tracer (conductivity 8 X 103 ms/m volume 2701) was injected into a tank facility (dimensions 10 X 10 X 3 m) consisting of alternating sand and clay layers. Injection was from 0.3 m below the surface, at a point where maximum interaction between tank structure and tracer transport was expected. Repeated imaging over a two-week period detected non-uniform tracer transport, partly caused by the sand/clay sequence. Tracery accumulation on two clay layers was observed and density-driven spill of tracer over a clay shelf was imaged. An additional unexpected flow pathway, probably caused by complications during array installation, was identified close to an electrode array. Pore water samples obtained following termination of electrical imaging generally supported the observed electrical response, although discrepancies arose when analysing the response of individual pixels. The pixels that make up the electrical images were interpreted as a large number of breakthrough curves. The shape of the pixel breakthrough-recession curve allowed some quantitative interpretation of solute travel time, as well as a qualitative assessment of spatial variability in advective-dispersive transport characteristics across the image plane. Although surface conduction effects associated with the clay layers complicated interpretation, the plotting of pixel breakthroughs was considered a useful step in the hydrological interpretation of the tracer test. The spatial coverage provided by the high density of pixels is the factor that most encourages the approach. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Although multielectrode electrical-resistivity systems have been commercially available for more than a decade, resistivity imaging of the subsurface continues to be based on data sets recorded using one or more of the standard electrode arrays (e.g., the Wenner or conventional dipole-dipole array). To exploit better the full capabilities of multielectrode acquisition systems, we have developed an experimental design procedure to identify suites of electrode configurations that provide subsurface information according to predefined optimization criteria. The experimental design algorithm includes a goodness function that ranks the sensitivity of every possible electrode configuration to changes in the subsurface parameters. To examine the potential and limitations of the new algorithm, comprehensive data sets that included data from all standard and nonstandard electrode configurations were (a) generated for a complex 2D resistivity model and (b) recorded across a well-studied test site in Switzerland. Images determined from the resultant comprehensive data sets were used as benchmarks against which the images derived from the optimized data sets were assessed. Images from relatively small optimized data sets, containing 265–282 data points, provided more information than did those from standard data sets of equal size.Byfar the best images, comparable to those determined from the much larger comprehensive data sets, were obtained from optimized data sets with 1000–6000 data points. These images supplied reliable information over depth ranges that were three times greater than the depth ranges resolved by the standard images. The first ∼600 electrode configurations selected by the experimental design procedure were nonstandard dipole-dipole-type arrays, whereas the following ∼4800 electrode configurations were an approximately equal mix of nonstandard dipole-dipole-type arrays and nested configurations (i.e., mostly gradient and other nonstandard arrays).},

With regard to the monitoring responsibility of site operators and the substantial expenses associated with permanent downhole installations, optimized experimental design gains particular importance. Based on an iterative appraisal of the formal model resolution matrix, we developed a method to estimate optimum electrode locations along the borehole trajectories with the objective to maximize the imaging capability within a prescribed target horizon. For the presented crosshole case, these layouts were found to be symmetric, exhibiting refined electrode spacings within the target horizon. Our results revealed that a sparse but well conceived set of electrodes can provide a large part of the information content offered by comparably dense electrode distributions.

abstract = {This paper describes a multi-plane implementation of a current-pulse electrical resistance tomography (ERT) data capture system. This is achieved by extending a single plane system, with 16 electrodes and 16 parallel measurement channels, to a one capable of acquiring data in a specified sequence across multiple planes (up to eight) by inserting multiplexer modules in parallel between the instrument and the electrode array. This approach allows high-speed capture systems to be configured for applications such as dual plane cross-correlation velocity measurements or more complex current injection and measurement sequences yielding 3D data sets. The measurement timing and multiplexer measurement sequences are implemented by an embedded processor. Both the executable code and the measurement sequence tables are downloaded to the instrument at start-up. This allows flexibility in specifying the data acquisition sequences and timing required for specific applications without modification of the hardware or embedded code. The effect of measurement noise on the estimated conductivity is quantified and spatial resolution discussed for the case of a 2D online imaging algorithm. Example reconstructions from recorded data sets are presented which verify the operation of the instrument.},

abstract = {The use of optimized resistivity tomography surveys to acquire field data imposes extra constraints on the design strategy beyond maximizing the quality of the resulting tomographic image. In this paper, methods are presented to (1) minimize electrode polarization effects (2) make efficient use of parallel measurement channels and (3) incorporate data noise estimates in the optimization process. (1) A simulated annealing algorithm is used to rearrange the optimized measurement sequences to minimize polarization errors. The method is developed using random survey designs and is demonstrated to be effective for use with single and multichannel optimized surveys. (2) An optimization algorithm is developed to design surveys by successive addition of multichannel groups of measurements rather than individual electrode configurations. The multichannel surveys are shown to produce results nearly as close to optimal as equivalent single channel surveys, while reducing data collection times by an order of magnitude. (3) Random errors in the data are accounted for by weighting the electrode configurations in the optimization process according to a simple error model incorporating background and voltage-dependent noise. The use of data weighting produces optimized surveys that are more robust in the presence of noise, while maintaining as much of the image resolution of the noise-free designs as possible. All the new methods described in this paper are demonstrated using both synthetic and real data, the latter having been measured on an active landslide using a permanently installed geoelectrical monitoring system. {\textcopyright} 2012 British Geological Survey/NERC Geophysical Journal International {\textcopyright} 2012 RAS.},

abstract = {The safety of an underground waste disposal site depends to a large extent on the presence and migration of the water in the rock. Geoelectrics is the most suitable method particularly in underground mining conditions to explore and monitor the moist zones in many different rocks. Recent developments in hardware, inversion schemes and petrophysical interpretation of the resistivity enable reliable and useful measurements to be conducted with direct current geoelectrics for exploration and monitoring also in salt rock environment with rather high resistivities and resistivity changes. Examples are presented for resistivity exploration and monitoring in rock salt. The measurements are carried out in the research mine Asse in North Germany which is used for investigations into handling, storage, disposal and geological interaction of nuclear waste. A fully automated geoelectric system suitable for salt rock environment and long-term monitoring was used with a large number of electrodes installed permanently. Logistical conditions allow measurements only in profiles so that two-dimensional inversion schemes had to be used and their suitability and limitations are shown. At one site where the moisture is visible in a limited area at the wall the extension of the moist zone in the rock is explored and determined. This helps to estimate the possible changes that might occur in future and which measures have to be taken. At another site in a large area in the rock salt the resistivity has been monitored over several months. The resistivity distribution in the area shows local variations indicating changes in the state of rock salt which is otherwise usually homogeneous. The changes are related to disturbed rock zone at near surface around the voids due to the stress induced by the mining, to the neighbouring cavities and also disturbed zones in the deeper rock due to the stress redistribution in the last 30 years since the excavations took place. Also significant changes of resistivity with time are detected for which an estimate of water content can be given. These are attributed to fluctuations of the water content in the disturbed rock areas. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

In some cases, it is the trace of the matrix rather than the diagonal that is needed. This paper describes methods for estimating diagonals and traces of matrices in these situations. The goal is to obtain a good estimate of the diagonal by applying only a small number of matrix-vector products, using selected vectors. We begin by considering the use of random test vectors and then explore special vectors obtained from Hadamard matrices. The methods are tested in the context of computational materials science to estimate the diagonal of the density matrix which holds the charge densities. Numerical experiments indicate that the diagonal estimator may offer an alternative method that in some cases can greatly reduce computational costs in electronic structures calculations. {\textcopyright} 2007 IMACS.},
